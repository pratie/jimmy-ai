# âš¡ Quick Deploy Guide - 5 Minutes to Production

## ðŸŽ¯ What You're Deploying

**Critical chatbot fixes** that enable customer email capture and conversation persistence. Without these, you're losing ~30% of potential customers.

---

## ðŸš€ Deploy in 3 Steps (5 minutes)

### **Step 1: Database Migration** (2 minutes)

#### Option A: Direct SQL (Recommended for production)
```bash
# Connect to your database
psql -U your_username -d your_database_name

# Run migration
\i migrations/fix_customer_unique_constraint.sql

# Verify constraint added
\d "Customer"
# Should show: "email_domainId" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (email, "domainId")
```

#### Option B: Prisma Migrate (If using Prisma migrations)
```bash
# Generate migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_customer_unique_constraint

# Apply to production
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**CRITICAL:** Check for duplicates FIRST:
```sql
-- Run this query - should return 0 rows
SELECT email, "domainId", COUNT(*)
FROM "Customer"
WHERE email IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY email, "domainId"
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

If you have duplicates, run the cleanup script in `migrations/fix_customer_unique_constraint.sql` Step 2.

### **Step 2: Deploy Code** (2 minutes)

#### Vercel
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: critical customer email capture bugs"
git push origin main
# Auto-deploys via Vercel
```

#### Railway / Render
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: critical customer email capture bugs"
git push origin main
# Auto-deploys
```

#### Manual (VPS / DigitalOcean)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: critical customer email capture bugs"
git push origin main

# SSH to server
ssh user@your-server.com
cd /path/to/corinna-ai
git pull
npm run build
pm2 restart corinna-ai
```

---

### **Step 3: Verify** (1 minute)

#### Quick Test
```bash
# Test customer creation
curl -X POST https://your-app.com/api/bot/stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "domainId": "YOUR-DOMAIN-UUID",
    "chat": [],
    "message": "My email is test@example.com",
    "anonymousId": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc"
  }'
```

#### Check Database
```sql
-- Should show new customer
SELECT * FROM "Customer" WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Should show linked chat room
SELECT * FROM "ChatRoom" WHERE "customerId" = (
  SELECT id FROM "Customer" WHERE email = 'test@example.com' LIMIT 1
);
```

#### Watch Logs (Optional)
```bash
# Look for these success logs:
[Bot Stream] ðŸ“§ Customer email detected: test@example.com
[Bot Stream] âœ… Customer found/created: <uuid>
[Bot Stream] ðŸ”— Linking anonymous chat history: <uuid>
```

---

## âœ… Success Checklist

- [ ] Migration ran successfully (no errors)
- [ ] Unique constraint exists on Customer table
- [ ] Code deployed (no build errors)
- [ ] Test customer created in database
- [ ] Chat room linked to customer
- [ ] No console errors in production logs

---

## ðŸš¨ Rollback Plan (If Something Breaks)

### Rollback Database
```sql
-- Remove unique constraint
ALTER TABLE "Customer" DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS "email_domainId";
```

### Rollback Code
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or manual rollback
git log  # Find previous commit hash
git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>
git push origin main --force
```

3. **`src/actions/bot/index.ts`**
   - Moved `customerEmail` to function scope (security fix)

### 3 Files Created:
1. **`migrations/fix_customer_unique_constraint.sql`** - Database migration

## ðŸ’¡ Quick FAQ

**Q: Will this break existing customers?**
A: No! Existing customers and chat rooms are preserved. New constraint only prevents future duplicates.

**Q: What if migration fails?**
A: Most likely you have duplicate customers. Run the duplicate check query, then cleanup script in Step 2 of migration file.

**Q: Do I need to restart my app?**
A: Yes, if using PM2/manual deployment. No, if using Vercel/Railway (auto-restart).

**Q: How do I test without affecting production?**
A: Use a test domain UUID that doesn't have real users. Or test in staging environment first.

**Q: What if I see errors after deployment?**
A: Check logs for specific error message. Most common: unique constraint violation = run migration first.

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

**Check logs first:**
```bash
# Vercel
vercel logs

# Railway
railway logs

# PM2
pm2 logs corinna-ai --lines 100
```

**Common issues:**
- "unique constraint violation" â†’ Run migration first
- "customer is null" â†’ Clear browser localStorage and test again
- "chatRoomId undefined" â†’ Check anonymousId is being sent from frontend
